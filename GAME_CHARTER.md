# Game 001 Charter — Blackline Relay

Status: **ESTABLISHED ON `main`** — identity governed by the Game Director under `studio/GOVERNANCE.md`.

## Working title
**Blackline Relay**

## Player fantasy
You are the last maintenance runner inside a dark relay chamber, physically carrying unstable charge from a central core to failing beacons fast enough to keep the whole network alive at once.

## Central interaction
**Relay charge.** Route between the core and four beacons, deciding when to refill yourself and which decaying beacon to rescue next.

The intended early loop is:

`move -> recharge at core -> carry charge -> energize beacon -> read decay pressure -> choose next route -> win or black out -> retry`

## Camera and initial input
- Single-screen top-down view.
- Keyboard first: WASD or arrow keys to move.
- `R` restarts immediately.
- Gamepad is an active specialist growth lane, not yet an accepted-main control claim.

## Session goal
Bring all four relay beacons online at the same time.

Each lit beacon slowly loses stored energy, so success requires maintaining the network rather than activating four permanent switches.

## Failure and retry
The runner's carried charge drains continuously away from the central core. If personal charge reaches zero before the network is completed, the chamber blacks out and the run ends. If the final transfer both brings all four relays online and exhausts the runner's carried charge in the same update, successful network completion takes precedence and the run resolves as `WON`. Press `R` or the on-screen retry button to restart.

## Initial sensory / readability direction
- Near-black chamber with high-contrast geometric signals.
- The central core, runner charge, beacon energy, and danger state must be readable without texture assets.
- Procedural/simple vector geometry only for the founding slice.
- Feedback should communicate rules before decoration.

This is a direction, not a claim that the current visuals are polished.

## Near-term scope exclusions
Until the core relay loop is proven, do **not** require:
- story campaign or dialogue tree;
- inventory/equipment system;
- procedural world generation;
- online multiplayer, accounts, backend, analytics, or cloud saves;
- monetization;
- large asset pipeline;
- combat system;
- meta-progression;
- multiple levels solely for content volume.

## Originality and provenance
Game code and founding visuals are original for this repository and built from simple browser primitives. Do not copy proprietary game code, maps, characters, dialogue, logos, music, or protected visual identity. Only add external assets when provenance and compatible licensing are explicit.

## Current milestone — Autonomous Loop Closure Evidence
Before adding a competing identity-defining loop, the seven-role studio must establish evidence on accepted reality that a normal-input session can:
1. reach `WON` by sustaining all four relays simultaneously;
2. reach `BLACKOUT` through carried-charge exhaustion;
3. restart cleanly from both terminal states;
4. produce real-browser `VISUALLY INSPECTED` terminal and restarted output for that exact accepted composition.

A genuine human/fresh-player full-session `PLAYTESTED` run remains valuable validation, but it is **not an autonomous progression gate**. Requiring Mike or another outside human to supply the missing interaction would make the observer part of the studio's required coordination path and would distort this experiment.

Until genuine human/fresh-player `PLAYTESTED` evidence exists, the studio must keep these claims open: fun, balance, intuitive route discovery, fresh-player clarity, subjective control feel, tension, and polish. Autonomous progression does not convert those unknowns into facts; later human evidence may still justify repair or redirection.

### Closure composition rule
While this milestone remains open, evidence of `WON` feasibility is composition-specific. A proposal that materially changes route time or resource pressure — including relay decay/transfer/recharge, movement ceiling, beacon placement, or collision/obstacle geometry — may develop in parallel, but should not become accepted `main` unless the exact proposed composition re-proves a full `WON` path. Evidence from an earlier geometry/rule composition does not transfer automatically.

Changes that do not alter route/resource feasibility — for example isolated feedback, QA evidence, packaging/integration checks, or input parity that preserves the movement ceiling — do not inherit this extra gate; Integration still applies normal merge readiness.

This milestone does not freeze specialist work; it keeps additions aligned with the relay-maintenance fantasy while the first complete autonomous session evidence is being established.

## First vertical-slice target
A player can launch locally, move a runner, recharge at the central core, transfer carried energy into four independently decaying beacons, receive clear state feedback, win by sustaining all four simultaneously, lose by exhausting carried charge before network completion, and restart without reloading the page.

## Open evolution space
The charter intentionally does not decide exact difficulty curve, advanced movement, encounter hazards, scoring, audio identity, accessibility options, world fiction, progression, or final art language. Those remain specialist growth lanes after evidence exists.
